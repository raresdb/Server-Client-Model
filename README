This is the implementation of a client-server communication.

The server represents a platform where messages can be published by UDP clients on different topics.
These messages can be seen by TCP clients that have subscribed to those topics.

The UDP client has not been implemented in this skel.

The TCP client can run the following commands:
-> subscribe topic SF
SF=1 means that the messages are stored for when the client is offline,
and SF=0 means they are not

-> unsubscribe topic

-> exit
this command will logout the client

The server will not run any commands, its only job being to receive messages and forward them to
various subscribers.
